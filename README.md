# Frontend Project Starter Template

Welcome to the Frontend Project Starter Template, your go-to repository for setting up modern web applications with the latest updates and best practices. This template leverages key technologies to streamline the development process, ensuring a robust foundation for your React-based projects.

## Core Technologies

 - `React` -> A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces through modular components.
 - `Pnpm` -> A fast, disk space-efficient package manager that optimizes dependency management.
 - `Vite` -> A cutting-edge build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
 - `TypeScript` -> A high-level programming language introducing static typing and optional type annotations to JavaScript.
 - `Shadcn/ui` -> A curated collection of reusable components, ready to be seamlessly integrated into your applications.
 - `TailwindCSS` -> An utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
 - `RTK Query` -> An advanced data fetching and caching tool, designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application.


## PNPM

We use Pnpm as our preferred package manager. To install Pnpm globally on your machine, open the Command Prompt and enter the following command:
`npm install -g pnpm`
Going forward, make sure to utilize Pnpm instead of npm when installing libraries for this project. For instance:
`pnpm install lodash`

## Project set up

This starter template incorporates the Shadcn/ui collection for UI components. Familiarize yourself with its functionalities by reading through the documentation: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
To customize the theme colors for your project, visit the https://ui.shadcn.com/themes website. Follow the provided instructions to update the project files. While some defaults are initially selected and can be found in the components.json file, feel free to overwrite them if you choose a different direction. Ensure you make these adjustments during the project's initiation, as it may require reinstalling components from the Shadcn collection.
